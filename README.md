# About

Jere Alho, [@jalho](https://github.com/jalho) on GitHub

This is the source of my personal website's **frontend** to be served at [j3.re](http://j3.re/).

The project's GraphQL **backend** can be found in its own repository at [jalho/j3.re_backend](https://github.com/jalho/j3.re_backend).

The project also serves as Full Stack Open 2020 ([MOOC](https://fullstackopen.com/) by University of Helsinki) personal final project. For that reason a working hours' tracking document is included in the repository under [temp/school](https://github.com/jalho/j3.re/blob/master/temp/school/Työaikakirjanpito.md).

## Required environment variables

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

Environment variables are excluded from version control by convention. They must be added manually to the environment.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the client with content of shape:

    REACT_APP_KEY1=VALUE1
    REACT_APP_KEY2=VALUE2

> [Note:](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`.

| required for | key | value | note |
|-|-|-|-|
| backend use | `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URI` | `https://j3re-backend.herokuapp.com/` | can change |
| backend Web Socket use | `REACT_APP_BACKEND_WSURI` | `wss://j3re-backend.herokuapp.com/graphql` | `wss://` with HTTPS |
